# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

The `ui.R` and `server.R` files in this repo contain the R code for the Beat Frequency Visualizer app available at:

  * https://dca-ds.shinyapps.io/beatFrequencies/

The app allows you to visualize the beat frequency for two sine waves: one with a frequency of 330 Hz (plotted in red) and another with a nearby frequency of your choice (plotted in blue). The interference pattern of the two waves is plotted in the bottom panel in black; the "beat frequency" is shown in the plot title.
